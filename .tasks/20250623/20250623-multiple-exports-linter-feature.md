# Feature Specification: Multiple Exports Linter

## Overview

**Problem Statement:** The codebase follows a "one export per file" convention to maintain code organization and readability, but currently lacks automated enforcement of this rule.

**Solution Summary:** Implement a new ESLint plugin that detects and flags files containing multiple exported classes, functions, or interfaces, while exempting barrel files (index.ts/index.js).

**Primary Goals:**

- Enforce the existing "one export per file" architectural principle
- Provide clear feedback when the rule is violated
- Support configurable checking of different export types
- Integrate seamlessly with existing ESLint plugin architecture

## Functional Requirements

1. **Export Detection:** Detect multiple exports of any combination of classes, functions, and interfaces within a single file
2. **Barrel File Exemption:** Skip linting for index.ts and index.js files (barrel files)
3. **Export Type Configuration:** Allow users to configure which export types to check (classes, functions, interfaces)
4. **Named and Default Export Support:** Detect violations in both named exports (`export class Foo`) and default exports (`export default class Foo`)
5. **Clear Error Reporting:** Provide specific error messages indicating which exports violate the rule
6. **Simple Auto-fix Suggestions:** Include general suggestions to split exports into separate files
7. **Plugin Integration:** Follow existing ESLint plugin patterns and integrate with the current linter structure

## Technical Requirements

**Technology Stack:**

- TypeScript 5.x with strict mode
- ESLint Rule API using ESTree AST nodes
- Jest for testing framework

**Architectural Patterns:**

- Follow existing plugin structure in `src/linters/`
- Use ESLintPlugin interface from `src/types.ts`
- Implement Rule.RuleModule pattern consistent with statement-count-plugin

**Integration Points:**

- Export from main `src/index.ts`
- Follow naming convention: `multiple-exports-plugin`
- Include in plugin configs (recommended/strict)

## User Stories

**Story 1:** As a developer, I want to be warned when I accidentally add multiple exports to a file so I can maintain code organization standards.

**Story 2:** As a team lead, I want to configure which types of exports to check so I can enforce our specific coding standards.

**Story 3:** As a developer working with barrel files, I want the linter to ignore index.ts files so I can use them for re-exports without violations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Detection Accuracy:** Rule correctly identifies files with 2+ exports of any combination of classes, functions, and interfaces
2. **Barrel File Exemption:** Rule ignores files named index.ts or index.js
3. **Configuration Support:** Rule accepts configuration object to enable/disable checking for specific export types
4. **Error Messages:** Clear, actionable error messages that identify the violation and suggest splitting files
5. **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive test suite covering all export scenarios and edge cases
6. **Performance:** Rule execution time comparable to existing plugins (< 100ms for typical files)
7. **Zero False Positives:** No incorrect flagging of single exports or barrel files

## Non-Goals

- Automatic file splitting or refactoring
- Specific filename suggestions for split files
- Checking import statements or dependencies
- Analyzing export usage across files
- Supporting non-JavaScript/TypeScript files

## Technical Considerations

**Dependencies:**

- ESLint Rule API
- ESTree AST node types
- Existing ESLint plugin infrastructure

**Constraints:**

- Must work with both JavaScript and TypeScript files
- Should not impact ESLint performance significantly
- Must integrate with existing quality pipeline (lint/test/build)

**Architectural Notes:**

- Use AST visitor pattern to traverse export declarations
- Implement configurable rule schema similar to statement-count-plugin
- Support both error and warning severity levels
- Follow existing error message formatting patterns

## Success Metrics

1. **Rule Effectiveness:** Successfully detects 100% of multi-export violations in test cases
2. **Integration Success:** Passes all existing quality checks (lint, format, test, build)
3. **Performance:** Rule execution adds < 5% to overall linting time
4. **Configuration Usability:** Rule configuration is intuitive and well-documented
5. **Developer Adoption:** Rule can be enabled without breaking existing compliant code
